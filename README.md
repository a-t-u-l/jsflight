# JSFlight
Tools to record user's activity and replay it later.
The project's main goal is to store major user events in a browser (mouse clicks, key presses) and them reproduce them using Selenium WebDriver.
Besides it can store HttpRequests on server-side and convert them to a JMeter Scenario to replay it later.

## Recording concepts
### Browser recording
* You should add some JS to a host page to record browsers events 
* Injected code will add some event handlers (you can easily configure what events should be recorded and what are not)
* Event handlers store their data in browser's session store
* Data from browser's session store is to be sent to the server with some period of time (Default period is 5 seconds)
* `javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet` on server side decides what to do with data it received

### Server-Side recording
* There is base class to be used to build a custom `javax.servlet.Filter`
* The filter will record any http request to urls it has been mapped to
* Of course you can add some special app's internal events to the recording. For example to monitor a production environment (or to get more data to replay user load more accurate)
